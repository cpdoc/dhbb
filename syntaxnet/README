This directory contains experiments involving SyntaxNex.

experiment0 is an attempt at processing DHBB using SyntaxNet by first
extracting the sentences via FreeLing and then using a naive approach
to identify the entities in the dictionary.

experiment1 is an attempt at using the WKS ground thruth for that: the
sentences and entities come from the ground truth generated by WKS and
the pre-annotation dictionaries.
