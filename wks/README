This directory contains files used in a WKS project.  The CSV files
are supposed to be imported as dictionaries for the specified types. 

The two JSON files are the two alternative type systems that can be
used.

The ground-truth/ directory contains a ground truth generated from
pre-annotating most of the DHBB entries using the dictionaries.  About
159 entries have to be left out since they were too big for WKS, which
has a maximum size limit of 40Kb per document.  See the end of the
README for a list of entries that were kept out:

types-836-roles.json: this version uses roles to establish the
hierarchy.  For example, we have a role PESSOA and types INDIVIDUO and
GRUPO that belong to that role.

types-836-subtypes.json: this version uses sub-types.  For example, we
have a type PESSOA and sub-types INDIVIDUO and GRUPO.

Unfortunately the current version of WKS does not support creating a
dictionary for a sub-type.

convert-dict.sh: converts a simple list of sentences to the format
expected by the dictionary importer.  See:

https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/wks/wks_t_dict_intro.shtml

The POS tag defaults to "3".

generate-csv.py: generates a single CSV file from multiple text files.
use this to import multiple files to WKS at once.  Importing each file
individually doesn't seem to work very well on the web interface.

type-system.txt: a text version of the type system described in
https://sites.google.com/site/anotacaododhbb/definicao-classes

These were the DHBB entries IDs that were kept out since their text
files were too big for WKS to process:
